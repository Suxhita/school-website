                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">"A 57-year-old teacher was arrested on charges of sexually abusing a seven-year-old student on Monday. Police said the boy, a student of Class III in a private school in Saidapet opened up to an uncle about the abuse he suffered under the accused, Reuben Ravi Kumar, a teacher in the same school.<br><br>
                    The behavior of the accused came to light when the family of the boy noticed a change in the boy’s behavior. “He seemed unusually tired every evening for at least a week. And he did not play during the weekend as he used to,” a close relative said. “We asked him what was wrong but he initially held back his experiences with the teacher. He later opened up to his paternal uncle,” he added.<br><br>
                    The family lodged a complaint with the police on Monday morning. As the news of the abuse spread, several parents rushed to the school and some allegedly even hit the accused teacher. Police rushed to the spot after the disruption was reported and took the teacher into custody.<br><br>
                    A case has been registered against the accused under section 23 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, read with Section 377 and 511 of the IPC. The accused was produced before a court in Saidapet which remanded him in judicial custody."

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A popular CBSE school in Chennai landed in controversy after a question paper termed the farmers who protested against the farm laws during the Republic Day tractor rally as "miscreants" and "violent maniacs."
                    The phrase was used in a politically charged question in a Class 10 exam paper and was framed in ‘letter to an editor’ format, as part of the English Language and Literature paper in the second revision exams held at DAV Boys school, News Minute reported on Friday.<br><br>
                    The exam was held on February 11. <br><br>
                    Part of Section B in the exam paper, the question read: “The diabolical violence that broke out in the national capital on Republic Day filled the hearts of the citizens with condemnation and abhorrence after the farm law protesters went on a rampage destroying public property and attacking police personnel in broad daylight. Write a letter to the Editor of a daily newspaper in your city, condemning such terrible, violent acts of miscreants who fail to realize that country comes before personal needs and gains. Destroying public property, disgracing the national flag, and attacking police personnel are few of the various illegal offences committed, that can never be justified for any reason whatsoever.” <br><br>
